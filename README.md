# 2021-NYC-election-data

Hello! This is a table of NYC Election Districts I cleaned and edited based on data requested from the [NYC Board of Elections](https://vote.nyc/). According the BoE, it's current for the June 2021 primary.

## Notes on territories that overlap

There are several City Council districts that straddle boroughs:
| CC District  | Borough 1 | Borough 2 | notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 8  | Bronx  | Manhattan  | Pretty even divide between East Harlem and South Bronx  |
| 34  | Brooklyn  | Queens  | none  |
| 22  | Bronx  | Queens  | Includes Rikers Island (Bronx), and is otherwise fully in Queens  |

There is one Assembly District that straddles boroughs, AD 64, which is mostly on Staten Island but also includes the northern part of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

## Unused EDs

Of the 5901 EDs in NYC, there were 236 tagged as "Unused EDs". I've used the "tagged as unused" column to indicate which these were. For example, 064/64 and 070/64 in Staten Island were marked as 'unused'. See the image below for an example of how they were included in the [official map](https://vote.nyc/sites/default/files/pdf/maps/ad/ad64.pdf). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6442309/116641916-8e851280-a922-11eb-9363-850f9bef5390.png)
